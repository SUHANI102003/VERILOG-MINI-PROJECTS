# VERILOG - HDL CODING

Hi everyone!! Let's dive into the world of RTL design and revise our Digital design concepts through HDL coding.

# ABOUT

This repository is a collection of all the verilog codes of combinational circuits that we learnt in digital design course.

Verilog is a Hardware Description Language (HDL) that is used to design the digital circuits through coding. 

The design (called module) can be designed at different levels of abstraction. This repository contains all modules with 3 levels of abstraction/modelling. They are-

1. DATAFLOW MODELLING 
2. STRUCTURAL/GATE LEVEL MODELLING
3. BEHAVIORAL MODELLING


Inside each folder you will find the following files:-

1. The design module (.v file)
2. The testbench file (_tb) (.v file)
3. The schematic of module
4. The simulation diagram
