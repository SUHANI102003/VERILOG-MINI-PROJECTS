# What is a PWM signal?

Digital signals are signals that can be represented by a 0 or 1. Analog signals on the other hand have a greater range of possible values than just a 0 or 1. Both of these signals are used in the electronics around us but they are handled very differently. If we need to take an analog input, we can get the real-time analog data from a sensor, and then using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), convert it to digital data for a microcontroller. But what if we need to control an analog device from our microcontroller? Some microcontrollers have an onboard digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to output a true analog signal in order to control analog devices and we can even use an external DAC. But a DAC is relatively expensive to produce in terms of cost and it also takes up a lot of silicon area. To overcome these issues and to easily achieve the functionality of a DAC in a much more cost-efficient way, we can use the technique of PWM.


PWM or Pulse Width Modulation is a technique used to control analog devices, using a digital signal. This technique can be used to output an analog-like signal from a digital device, like a microcontroller. We can control motors, lights, actuators, and more using the generated PWM signal. An important thing to note here is that PWM is not a true analog signal. The digital signal is modified in a way to fake an analog signal.



## EXPLANATION

With electrical components, you can control the current delivered to them, even if the only control you have is switching the power supply on and off. You can rapidly switch the power supply on and off in a pattern to control the current delivered to the device. Keeping it “on” for a duration more than the “off” duration will raise the average power level and doing it the opposite way will reduce the average power level. We can generate a varied range of speeds (analog) for our motors and actuators even though in reality we are just switching between the two possible states of being on and off (digital). This is exactly what a PWM signal is.


The switching on and off is the pulse. The duration for which the pulse is held at a high state is the pulse width. T represents the total time taken to complete a cycle. Modulation refers to the modification of the original signal to get our desired signal. So we are modifying a signal or pulse such that it is “on” for the duration as per our need, hence, Pulse-Width-Modulation.

## DUTY CYCLE

In signals, we define logic high as “on-time”. To represent the duration of “on-time”, we use the concept of duty cycle. In simple terms, the duty cycle describes the percentage of time a digital signal is “on” over an interval or period. It is represented in percentage (%).

Let’s take a signal with a maximum voltage of 10V. If our signal takes one second to complete a cycle and the signal is on for 0.5 seconds and off for the other 0.5 seconds, this is called a 50% duty cycle and we will get 5V as the average voltage output. If the signal is on for 0.75 seconds and off for the other 0.25 seconds, it will be a 75% duty cycle and the output will be 7.5V. The below image represents signals having different duty cycles and the average voltage generated by them:

## FREQUENCY

Just like the duty cycle, frequency is also a primary component that defines a PWM signal’s behavior. It is the number of times a signal repeats per second. The frequency required depends on the application. For example, the frequency of a PWM signal should be sufficiently high if we wish to see a proper dimming effect while controlling LEDs. A duty cycle of 20% at 1 Hz will be noticeable to the human eye that the LED is turning ON and OFF. However, if we increase the frequency to 100Hz, we’ll get to see the proper dimming of the LED.
